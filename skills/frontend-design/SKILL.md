# Frontend Design

Build distinctive, production-grade interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Before Coding

1. **Purpose**: What problem? Who uses it?
2. **Tone**: Pick BOLD direction - brutalist, retro-futuristic, luxury, playful, editorial, organic, etc.
3. **Differentiation**: What makes this unforgettable?

## Design Principles

### Typography
- Distinctive fonts, not generic (avoid Inter, Arial, Roboto)
- Pair display font with refined body font
- Unexpected, characterful choices

### Color
- Cohesive theme with CSS variables
- Dominant colors with sharp accents
- Avoid timid, evenly-distributed palettes

### Motion
- CSS-only when possible, Motion library for React
- Focus on high-impact moments: orchestrated page load with staggered reveals
- Scroll-triggered effects, surprising hover states

### Composition
- Asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Atmosphere
- Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies, dramatic shadows
- Custom cursors, grain overlays

## NEVER Use

- Overused fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Predictable layouts and patterns
- Cookie-cutter designs without context

## Execution

Match complexity to vision:
- Maximalist → elaborate animations, extensive effects
- Minimalist → restraint, precision, subtle details

Design for 2025 awwwards quality. Commit fully to the vision.
